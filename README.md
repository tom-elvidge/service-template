- ~~Create the template service which implements the generated server library~~
- ~~Set up Codespaces with pre-builds for easy demonstration~~
- ~~Generate a client library~~
- ~~Create a demo application which uses the client library to make requests to the template service~~
- Create a CI pipeline with GitHub Actions to test, build and scan all the projects, as well as publish the client library
- Process for handling versioning in CI
- Create a CD pipeline with GitHub Actions to deploy the template service
- Extend the template service to follow Domain Driven Design
- Back the template service by a database and update CD pipeline with new infrastructure as code
